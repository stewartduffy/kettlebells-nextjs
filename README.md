# Kettlebells Scraper App

I built this app durring Covid lockdown as I was trying to buy some Kettlebells, and all the sites in NZ had sold out of the sizes I needed. I built this so help me buy some kettlebells when they came in stock.

- UI & API's built with NextJS
  - Lists the options available with a link to buy
  - Api to scrap fitness websites using a get request then parse response using cheerio
- Runs request on cron job using Google Cloud Scheduler
- Sends email notifications using mail mailgun email service with link to buy kettlebell!

## Did it work?

Yes it did!

- This side project was fun, kept me sane durring Covid.
- Helped me buy some more kettlebells quickly when they were in stock.
- Good way to play with a few different technologies to solve a problem.
